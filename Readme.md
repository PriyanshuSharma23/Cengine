# Cengine (C++ Local Search Engine)

Inspired from [Seroost by Tsoding](https://github.com/tsoding/seroost), this is a C++ implementation of the same idea.
I have cloned the documentation of [doc.gl](https://doc.gl) and have made a local search engine for it.

## Dependencies

- [RapidXml v1.13](http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/) - For parsing the XML files

## Usage

- Clone the repository, and cd into it.
- Run the following command to build the project:

```bash
make
```

- Or, build and run the project:

```bash
./run.sh
```
